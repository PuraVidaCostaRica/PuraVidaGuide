            <p>Long before European ships crossed the Atlantic, the land we now call Costa Rica was already alive with
              stories. These stories weren't about conquests or wars, but about life—about people for whom jungles,
              volcanoes, and oceans weren't exotic wonders, but home.</p>
            <p>The first traces of human presence in what is now Costa Rica date back to around 10,000 BCE. These were
              nomadic tribes of hunters and gatherers, slowly moving through Central America in search of food and
              shelter. They left behind obsidian and flint tools, simple pottery, and burial sites that reveal their
              beliefs about life and death.</p>

            <p>One of the most iconic artifacts of that time are the stone spheres—perfectly round, still puzzling
              archaeologists today. Who made them, how, and why? The answers remain elusive. But that is part of the
              magic of pre-Columbian Costa Rica: it doesn't dazzle with empires, but with mystery.</p>

          <img src="img/about/history/columbus_arrival.webp" alt="Arrival of Columbus to Costa Rica" class="img-right" />
          <p>1492 forever changed the course of history for the entire continent. But Costa Rica first heard the name
            Christopher Columbus a little later — in 1502, when he arrived here during his fourth, most difficult, and
            enigmatic voyage.</p>
          <p>Columbus approached the eastern coastline of the country — to what is now known as Limon. There, he was
            greeted by the local people, strong, adorned with gold jewelry, impressive, and free. It was then that the
            myth arose, giving the country its name — "rich coast", <em>Costa Rica</em>. Although Columbus did not find
            golden cities here, he thought that this land was full of treasures — cultural, natural, and human.</p>

        <h2>The Colonial Period</h2>
        <div class="info-card">
        <div class="clearfix">
          <img src="img/about/history/cartago_foundation.webp" alt="Foundation of Cartago" class="img-left" />
          <p>The Spanish founded Cartago, the first capital of Costa Rica, in the early 16th century. However, the
            colony developed slowly and remained poor, as there was no gold or other valuable resources on this land to
            attract the Spanish, unlike in other parts of Central America.</p>
          <p>The irony lies in the fact that it was the absence of gold deposits that saved the indigenous people from
            extermination. While in other regions, where gold became the main objective for the Spanish, the native
            populations were often subjected to violence and destruction, Costa Rica, lacking rich mineral resources,
            was less attractive to the invaders.</p>

        <h2>Path to Independence and Modernity</h2>

        <div class="clearfix">
          <img src="img/about/history/independence.webp" alt="Independence of Costa Rica" class="img-right" />
          <p>Costa Rica gained independence from Spain on September 15, 1821, along with most of the countries in
            Central America. However, unlike many of its neighbors, Costa Rica avoided long and bloody wars for
            independence. This was possible due to the political maturity of local leaders and the fact that there were
            no precious metals in the country that invaders could claim.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="clearfix">
          <img src="img/about/history/independence1.webp" alt="Modern Costa Rica" class="img-left" />
          <p>One of Costa Rica's defining features has been its commitment to peace. In 1948, after a brief civil war,
            the country made a decisive step toward a peaceful future by abolishing its army. This decision became a
            symbol of the country's dedication to peaceful development, and to this day, Costa Rica remains one of the
            few countries in the world without a standing military.</p>
          <p>Modern Costa Rica is a thriving democratic state with a developing economy and a high standard of living.
            The country is known for its sustainable development, environmental policies, and efforts to preserve its
            rich natural heritage.</p>

            <div class="info-card">
              <img loading="lazy" src="img/about/myths/maria1.png" alt="Maria" class="myth-img-left" />
              <p>On dark nights, when the moon hides behind clouds and the wind whispers through the leaves of giant
                trees, you can hear a chilling, piercing cry along the banks of Costa Rican rivers. It is La Llorona —
                the Weeping Woman, a spirit condemned to eternal suffering.</p>
              <div class="clearfix">
                <h3>The Story of María</h3>
                <p>Long ago, in a small village by the Tarcoles River, there lived a beautiful young woman named María.
                  She was poor, but her beauty outshone even the brightest flowers in the tropical forest. One day, a
                  wealthy Spanish nobleman arrived in the village — handsome, arrogant, with cold eyes. Upon seeing
                  María, he became enchanted by her and promised to marry her if she gave him heirs.</p>
                <p>Passionate love blinded María, and soon they had two children — a boy and a girl. But as the children
                  grew older, the nobleman grew cold toward their mother. He announced that he would marry a noblewoman
                  from the city, and María and her children were cast out of his home.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="clearfix">
                <h3>The Fateful Night</h3>
                <img loading="lazy" src="img/about/myths/maria2.png" alt="Maria by the river" class="myth-img-right" />
                <p>In despair, María wandered the riverbank, clutching a handkerchief soaked with her tears. Her heart
                  broke with pain: how could she, a poor peasant woman, raise her children alone? What if they starved?
                  Better death than disgrace…</p>
                <p>Madness overtook her. In the darkness, with the sound of the river's waters, she grabbed her children
                  and... threw them into the black abyss. The children vanished into the whirlpool, and when María came
                  to her senses, she realized what she had done. With a wild scream, she threw herself into the river,
                  but death did not claim her.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="clearfix">
                <h3>The Eternal Curse</h3>
                <p>Since then, her spirit has never known peace. Every night, she roams the riverbanks in white clothes,
                  soaked with her eternal tears, crying:</p>
                <blockquote>"¡Ay, mis hijos! ¿Dónde están mis hijos?" ("Oh, my children! Where are my children?")
                </blockquote>
                <p>They say that if you hear her cry, you should run without looking back. Anyone who succumbs to pity
                  and approaches her will see her face — sometimes beautiful, sometimes distorted in horror. Some even
                  say she can drag a person into the water, mistaking them for her lost child…</p>

                <h3>A Warning</h3>
                <p>Elderly people in Costa Rica still say:</p>
                <blockquote>"Don't go near the river at night, or La Llorona will take you."</blockquote>
                <p>They especially warn children not to play by the water at dusk.</p>
                <p>But sometimes, on particularly quiet nights, when even the cicadas fall silent, her sobs echo through
                  the forest…</p>
                <p>Would you dare to go near the river at night?</p>

            <h2>El Cadejo: The Secret Guardian of the Night</h2>
            <div class="info-card">
              <div class="clearfix">
                <img loading="lazy" src="img/about/myths/black-dog.png" alt="White Cadejo in the forest"
                  class="myth-img-left" />
                <p>In the dense Costa Rican forests, where tree shadows merge into a black void and roads vanish into
                  darkness, a mysterious creature roams—<strong>El Cadejo</strong>, a spectral hound divided between
                  salvation and damnation.</p>

                <h3>Two Hounds, Two Fates</h3>
                <p>Legends speak of two Cadejos: one white, one black. The <strong>white Cadejo</strong>, with fur like
                  moonlight and eyes like burning coals, protects lost travelers—especially the drunk and vulnerable.
                  The
                  <strong>black Cadejo</strong>, reeking of decay and with hellfire eyes, stalks sinners, luring them
                  into
                  the jungle's depths.
                </p>

              <div class="clearfix">
                <h3>The Tale of Rafael</h3>
                <img loading="lazy" src="img/about/myths/white-dog.png" alt="Black Cadejo lurking"
                  class="myth-img-right" />
                <p>In San José, a cruel drunkard named Rafael terrorized his village. One night, stumbling home, he
                  heard
                  ragged breathing behind him. Turning, he saw the black Cadejo—its red eyes locked onto him like a
                  predator. Rafael ran, but the beast matched his steps. Desperate, he screamed:</p>
                <blockquote>"¡Por favor, déjame! ¡No quiero morir!" ("Please, let me go! I don't want to die!")
                </blockquote>
                <p>Just as the black hound lunged, the white Cadejo erupted from the shadows. The two clashed in a fury
                  of
                  teeth and growls, while Rafael collapsed, unconscious.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="clearfix">
                <h3>Redemption or Ruin</h3>
                <p>At dawn, villagers found Rafael alive—but changed. He swore off drink and violence, forever haunted
                  by
                  the night the Cadejos chose his fate. Some say the white hound spared him as a warning; others whisper
                  the black one still waits for his next misstep.</p>

                <h3>A Shadow at Your Back</h3>
                <p>To this day, Costa Ricans warn:</p>
                <blockquote>"If you hear heavy breathing at night, don't look back. Run toward the light."</blockquote>
                <p>Was it the white Cadejo guiding you? Or the black one, testing your soul? Only the jungle knows—and
                  it
                  keeps its secrets well.</p>
                <p>Would you risk walking alone after dark?</p>

                <p>In the dark alleys of Costa Rica's old towns, where streetlights flicker like owl's eyes, a
                  mysterious
                  beautiful stranger sometimes appears.</p>

                <h3>The Deadly Deception</h3>
                <p>She emerges from the mist — tall, slender, wearing a white dress with thick dark hair. Her face
                  remains
                  shadowed, but her voice is sweet as honey.</p>
                <blockquote>"Walk me home, handsome..." she whispers, and enchanted men always agree.</blockquote>
                <p>But as they come closer, La Segua turns her head — revealing not a beautiful face but the horrifying
                  visage
                  of a horse: bloodshot eyes, sharp fangs, and a grotesque snout!</p>

                <h3>The Proud Girl's Curse</h3>
                <p>Legend says La Segua was once an ordinary girl — beautiful but cruel. She mocked men, broke hearts,
                  and swore
                  no one deserved her love.</p>
                <p>One night, a stranger in black appeared to her and asked:</p>
                <blockquote>"So confident in your beauty? Then look in this mirror..."</blockquote>
                <p>The girl looked — and saw her true face. From that moment, she was cursed to roam Costa Rica's roads,
                  luring
                  arrogant men to show them their own sins.</p>
              </div>

                  class="myth-img-left" />
                <p>If a beautiful stranger approaches you at night:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Don't look into her eyes</strong> — her power comes from eye contact</li>
                  <li><strong>Whisper a prayer</strong> — La Segua fears holy words</li>
                  <li><strong>Throw salt at her feet</strong> — this may briefly stop her</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But the best protection? <strong>Never walk alone at night.</strong></p>
